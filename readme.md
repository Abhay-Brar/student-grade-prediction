# Student Grade Prediction using Machine Learning

Predict final student grades (`G3`) using demographic, lifestyle, and academic data with machine learning algorithms.



# Project Overview

This project uses a real-world dataset of Portuguese high school students to predict their final math exam scores. The goal is to build and compare regression models that can predict student performance using features like study time, past grades, family background, and more.



# Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- pandas & numpy to handle data
- matplotlib & seaborn for visualization 
- scikit-learn to use Random forest and Linear Regression
